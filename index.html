<h1>Basic Information</h1>
 
<!--- TAB 1 DESCRIPTION ---!>
 
<p align="Left">Name: Kina Buvelle<p>
<p align="left">Weight: 127lbs   <p>                                                             
<p align="left">Height: 5'4<p>
<p align="left">Age: Seventeen<p>
<p align="left">Gender: Female<p>
<p align="left">Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual / Bicurious<p>
<p align="left">Race: Human<p>
<p align="left">Rank: Archmage ( Faith + Geo )<p>
<p align="left">Primary Tree: Faith<p>
<p align="left">Secondary Tree: Geomancy<p>
<p align="left">Points: 439 <p>
<p align="left">Appearance: Kina's body doesn't have the distinct hourglass figure that a lot of girls have, her shape making more of a curve than a point to her waist and leads down into another smooth curve to her hips and long legs. Her skin is a light peach shade, some considering her to be pale. Her platinum blonde hair frames her skin causing her to look a little darker than she really looks. <p>
Her facial structure is distinctly European, her narrow nose pricking up at the tip as well as her plump pink lips. Kina's cheekbones are the widest part of her face which causes it to have a slight heart shape that leads into her narrow jaw which fits her overall frame perfectly. Her baby blue eyes are often described as piercing.<p>
<p align="left">Personality: Kina is a fairly kind individual, often putting the needs of others beyond her own. She would do next to anything to help another if the need proposed itself to her, given it be something she is able to help with. Calm and contemplative, she lost most her impulsiveness and temperament issues quickly after arriving at Ulreich. <p>
Kina still has her sense of humor and is still slightly feisty but she gained a bit more gentleness. She now strives to uphold peace and promote prosperity but is definitely not above fighting for what she believes is right, especially it is keeps those she loves out of danger.

<h1>Mana Manipulation and Universal Spells</h1>
 
<!--- TAB 3 DESCRIPTION ---!>
 Mana Manipulation: The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level.<p>
Unique Archmage Mana Type: Earth Warden Mana: Earth Warden Mana is a combination of both her Faith Mana and her Geomancy Mana types. This mana is capable of being manifested in both physical and essence-based forms while also being capable of being infused into both sentient and non-sentient beings.<p>
Faith Mana: Mana which cannot do damage in any form. This mana is usually very warm and pleasant, and sometimes even gives off relaxing scents.<p>
Earth Mana: Mana which manifests itself as dirt, mud, dust, etc..<p>
<p>
<font color="#D4AF37">Kina's mana<font color="#808080">, when visible to the naked eye, appears as an aura of bright gold, yet has a thin inner and outer border of a muted shade of brown that blends perfectly into the gold hues. Browns and other nude shades can be seen as small particles drifting inside of her aura.
 <p>
Mana Weave: The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana<p>
Mana Spark: A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.<p>
Mana Pane: When focusing one's mana before them and swirling it in a vortex quickly and violently, one may allow their mana to harden, causing a thin pane to form. This spell can only be used defensively and the power it can block is minimal, ranking at iron toughness. This spell can be learned by anyone of mage rank and above, but upon reaching high mage, one may cast two of these at a time, one for each hand.<p>
Mana Beacon: This spell is cast by concentrating on one's mind and projecting mana outwards like a sudden flash of light. Although this does not produce any visual effects, it sends a beacon-like pulse of mana outwards from ones body which can be picked up an interpreted by other mages who have learned this spell. It does not convey any message, rather a simple alarm. This can be used to send a cry for help to people within a set area of your character.<p>
Gel Sphere: By creating a mana spark and continuing to weave your mana around the spark like a web, eventually the orb one forms will expand into a small sphere of an incredibly adhesive substance. Once casted, this spell lasts for three posts, and has a toughness of aluminum. <p>
Summon Medium:A spell that allows a user to transport their medium from a previous location into their hands. Only one medium can be used at a time with this spell, and can include HMM's, as well as basic objects and weapons. To change one's medium, one must use it at least once before being able to actively summon it. <p>
Mana Meditation: â€‹This spell takes two posts, the first post charges the spell, the second post activates it. If a mage meditates on whatever is causing them pain or discomfort--meaning they focus their undivided attention inward or to whatever specific part of their body is hurting--and slowly weave their mana to that particular place, they will be able to activate this spell. Mana Meditation increases a mage's natural pain tolerance slightly and can calm whatever natural shock they may be experiencing, allowing them to function better. Natural shock meaning the universal spell won't work on magic based shock<p>
Mana Rehabilitation: This spell takes two posts, the first post charges the spell, the second post activates it. If a mage temporarily focuses on whatever is causing them pain or discomfort--meaning they focus their most of their attention inward or to whatever specific part of their body is hurting or being affected by an external source--and weave their mana to that particular place, they will be able to activate this spell. Mana Rehabilitation increases a mage's natural pain tolerance by x1.5 and can calm whatever natural shock or magic based shock (spells that cause pain/shock/discomfort of up to Mage rank) that part of their body may be experiencing. (Can take a tiny bit of edge off higher ranked spells, but not very much, will mainly be ineffective to anything higher than mage rank.)

<h1>Spells and Items</h1>
 
<!--- TAB 4 DESCRIPTION ---!>
 Items -- 
Incandescence ( High Mage Medium ) - Whilst this shield is summoned, all of Kina's buffs' durations are increased by 1.5x of their normal time, and the defensive capabilities of her spells such as Angelic Bulwark are increased by 1.75x. Her geomancy spells also get boosted, the length, width, and height of all of her spells getting increased by 1.5x, all except her Grasping Hands, and Sandstorm. It's durability is equal to that of tungsten, and is very resistant to magic and physical forces alike.<p>
Death's Embrace : A magically enhanced Warhammer retrieved from the siege of Kre'nath. This hammer gives it's holder 2x their base strength, allowing them to wield it with both hands much easier. If struck on any solid surface with enough force, the hammer releases a ring of ice from the point of impact in a three foot radius, the explosive force being enough for the ice to cut through anything equal to or below an Iron density. The handle and the hammer head are both made of Cobalt and the handle is five and a half feet tall, the head adding another foot. This puts it at a whopping six and a half feet tall. The hammer head has a two foot span from handle to each end, making it four feet long in total while being one foot in width.
<p>
 Faith Spells - <p>
Heal - By projecting her mana through the palms of her hands, she floods the recipients body with white mana. The mana mends broken bones, internal bleeding, flesh wounds, and the like. The larger and more devastating the wound, the more mana the spell takes. This can not regenerate lost limbs.<p>
Cleanse - Another spell transmitted via touch. Cleanse targets both magic and physical ailments such as induced blindness, poisons, curses, and other effects. This spell can only cure spells equal to or less than Kina's rank. Does not affect spells she has no knowledge of.<p>
Fortitude - Blesses an ally target, increasing their physical abilities by 1.5x ( strength, endurance, vitality, speed ) and also doubles their pain tolerance. Lasts for five posts.<p>
Angelic Bulwark - By extending her mana from her body in a bubble shape, she forms a thick, protective bubble of mana, it's boundaries distinguished by it's dull golden glow. The spell is like a one-way mirror when it comes to casting spells; if a spell is cast from outside, the bubble absorbs it depending on it's magnitude and rank, and spells cast from inside pass freely. The shield may be passed like air, meaning that inside, it's open season. Can absorb up to one High Mage ranked spell ( varies depending on spell strength. )<p>
Sanctuary - Blesses the ground beneath Kina in a ten meter radius, causing the ground to crack in a spiderweb pattern, light bursting from the cracks. This light heals allied targets for a small amount once every post. Spells cast by harmful entities inside the radius have their spell rank reduced by one rank. Lasts for three posts.<p>
Infusion - After channeling for one post, Kina releases a burst of mana. Allied targets within this blast radius have their next spell cost reduced to half.<p>
Apotheosis - A powerful buff that only applies to the durability of barriers, Kina increases the target's barrier strength by 4x. Rather than increasing the material strength of the barrier, it increases the barrier's ability to absorb damage - I.E. 1 spell of equal rank to 4 spells of equal rank, before breaking. Lasts for 4 posts and has a 2 post cd.<p>
Sensory Pulse - By releasing a pulse of faith mana into the target, the spell works like echolocation. The mana bounces off of every part of them and returns to Kina, allowing her to "see" any internal and external injuries such as internal bleeding, respiratory problems, etc. This spells works to find both physical and magic induced problems and is able to detect harmful spells of up to HM+ rank. Does not detect spells that are intentionally hidden by the caster.<p>
Geomancy Spells -<p>
Wall - Erects a six foot tall, three four foot wide, and three foot thick wall of whichever substance she chooses. Lasts for three posts or until destroyed.<p>
Earthern Needles - Forms the earth into jagged, pointed needles of rock, and sends them towards a target. These are projectile spells, and only three can be summoned at a time.
Spikes - Summons a five foot long spike of earth from the ground, making obstacles and dealing damage on impact.<p>
Sandstorm -Grinds the ground with the force of her mana, and manipulates the sand and debris created. These particles are whirled around her body like a twister, dealing light damage once per post, and heavily reducing eyesight fo5r up to thirty feet from her.<p>
Rock Armament - Focusing her mana around her fists, she wills it to become her tree's respective physical element: Rock. This causes rock to form around her fists, molding to the shape of her hands to form large gauntlets of solid stone which have the durability of Iron. She is able to flex her hands within the gauntlet, which in turn causes the gauntlet to follow her movements like any other normal set of gloves. If she is able to connect a solid punch, the weight behind the punch could easily break bones. The gauntlets are easily fourty each, but to her they feel closer to ten pounds. Can break through Iron defenses with multiple hits.<p>
<p>
Archmage Spells --<p>
Gaia's Shield - Erects a physical barrier that is ten feet wide and tall in a dome shape. It can block physical objects twice Kina's weight and size so long as their toughness does not exceed Titanium. Can also block magical constructs of Titanium or lower. Consecutive attacks from Cobalt and Titanium can break through. Once the dome is broken, there is a one post cool down before it can be cast again.<p>
Rapture - After charging for one post, releases a powerful burst of faith mana. The explosive force of it is capable of knocking back a mage with less then or equal to 2x human strength. This spell has two effects: 1 - It heals for light damage to selective targets such to the extent of like a twisted ankle. 2 - It uproots the ground, sending up to four spikes that are three feet long from the ground at awkward angles.<p>
Gift of Stone - A powerful buff that increases physical strength by 3x, while also increasing the recipient's weight to counter balance it. Without the strength buff, they wouldn't be able to move very well. They now weigh as if they were stone ( 50- 100ish lbs increase ). If the target's durability already exceeds stone, then this buff will not be effective at all. This lasts for 4 posts, and has a 1 post cool down time.<p>
